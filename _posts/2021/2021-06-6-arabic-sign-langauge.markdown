## WHAT IS Arabic SIGN LANGUAGE (ArSL)?
Arabic Sign Language or ArSL as it’s popularly called by its acronym, is a fascinating language and many people have started to see its value and purpose outside the Deaf community. It is a visual language formed by organized hand gestures, body movements, and facial expressions. Learning ArSL won’t just create meaningful relationships but will provide more job opportunities, as it’s becoming increasingly essential in many workplaces. Its growing popularity highlights the demand for non-verbal communication that enriches confidence in communicating with people in everyday scenarios. The ArSL alphabet (a.k.a fingerspelling) is one of the easier challenges when learning sign language and it’s a sign language basic necessary to know in order to succeed.

Note: ArSL uses only one hand to form the letters in the alphabet.
